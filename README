Demo of reading two input files and writing an edited version of one of the
files enriched with metadata from the other file. The purpose of this is to
show a friend a way to solve a particular bio-informatics problem. As a demo
there is no error handling, but an error here would likely indicate an error in
an upstream tool.

I am new to python and wrote this as if it were ruby, so please don't consider
this instructional in terms of python style or idioms.
