Demo of reading file and writing out an editted version of the file that
conforms to a new format to help a someone solve a bio-informatics problem. I
don't know python and basically wrote this like I would write ruby and just
read the docs as I went, so don't take this as perfectly idiomatic python (read
the docs/PEPs for that!). -PH
